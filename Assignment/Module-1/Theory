---> what is software
software is a set is computer program and associated documenttation and data.
software is a set of program. which is designed to perform a well-defined function which is use to solve perticular problem.

--->what is software engineering
definition of software engineering is detailed study of engineering to the design, development and maintenance of software.
software engineering is defined as a process of analyzing user requirements and then designing, building and testing software application which will satisfy those requirements.

--->Explain type of software?
there are 3 type of software
1). system software
2). application software
3). programming software

# system software 
system software is the first layer of software to be loaded into memory every time a computer is powered up.
system software carries out middleman tasks to ensure communication between other software and hardware to allow harmonious 
coexistence with the user.
the operating system(OS) is a type of system software kernel that sits between computer hardware and end user.
i.e, Linux, Windows, macOS.. etc type of OS

# application software 
there are 3 type of application software.
1). desktop application
   ex. windows files explorer, microsoft office application, abode photoshop, skype, discord,liiustrator etc...
2). wab application
   ex.   Gmail, google docs, google analytics, microsoft office 365 etc...
3). mobile application
     like Education, Lifestyle, social media, productivity, Entertainment and game application

    # programming software 
    programming software is a software which helps the programmer in devloping other software.
    compilers, assemblers, debuggers, interpreters etc. are examples of programming software. 
    integrated development environments (IDEs) are combination s of all these software.

---> What is SDLC ? Explain each phase of SDLC.
the software development life cycle(SDLC) refers to a methodology  with clearly defined processes for creating hight-quality software.
in detail, the SDLC methodology focuses on the following phases  of software development,

1~ Requirements gathering 
2~ Analysis and planning
3~ Design 
4~ implementation
5~ testing
6~ maintenance


# 1 requirement gathering 
    the requirements is the first stage in the SDLC process. this stage gives a clearer picture of the scope of the entire project and
    the anticipated issues, requirement gathering stage need teams to get detailed and precisw requirements.


#2  analysis and planning
     End user business requirement analysis takes place during this phase. project goals are coverted into the defined system functions that 
     the organization intends to develop.


#3 design 

    in this third phase, the system and software desing document are preparedas pare the requirement specification document.
    this help define overall system architecture.

#4 implementation 
    once the system design phase is over, the next phase is implementation, in this phase developers start build the entire syste by 
    writing code using the chosen programming language. in the phase of implementation, tasks are divided into unitsor modules and 
    assigned to the various developers.

#5 testing

   when the software is complete and it is deployed in the testing  environment. the testing team stat testing the functionality of 
   the entire system. this is done to verify that the entire application work accoding to the customer requirement

#6  maintenance

   the system is deployed and customer start using the developed system following 3 activitied occur 
   Bug fixing, upgrade and enhancement
   
   
---> what is DFD ? & creat a DFD diagram on flipkart
   A data floe diagram is a graphical or visual representation using a standardized set os symbols and notation to describe a business's
   operation through data movement.
   > to represent data into DFD there are 4 elements that are used. a) external entity
                                                                    b) prosses
                                                                    c) data flow
                                                                    d) data store
---> what is flow chart       
Flowcharts are nothing but the graphical representation of the data or the algorithm for a better understanding of the code visually.
It displays step-by-step solutions to a problem, algorithm, or process.
